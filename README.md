# etch-a-sketch
An online pixel art application. While primitive, users have access to a few neat tools. 

Shading, dodging, color swithcing, and increasing the size of each cell on the grid are options available to users. Of course, no paiting app would be complete without a canvas clearer or eraser.

The styling could use an update.
